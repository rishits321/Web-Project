# Space Protag


## Brief Idea
This was a fun little project I made during the course of CS50. It is a game completely designed and developed by me about space.
Help the spaceship save all the astronauts while avoiding the asteroids. The hotter and redder they are more dangerous they are.

Try it out by downloading and opening the [SpaceProtag.html](https://github.com/rishits321/Web-Project/blob/main/SpaceProtag/SpaceProtag.html) file and have fun playing in your browser.
