## Brief Idea
In this project, we have created a real-time chat application using Agora.io's video chat API and JavaScript. The application allows users to enter a chat room and communicate with each other via video, audio, and text messages. We have used Agora.io's API to handle video and audio communication, and JavaScript to implement the chat functionality.

The application is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and use. We have also implemented various features such as chat message notifications, user status updates, and mobile number validation to enhance the user experience.

Overall, this project provides an excellent example of how to create a real-time chat application using Agora.io's video chat API and JavaScript. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this project can serve as a valuable resource for building your own real-time chat applications.
