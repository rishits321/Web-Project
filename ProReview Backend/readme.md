# ProReview, a site for public reviews backend REST API implementation


## Brief Idea
This project implements the backend of a Review service as a REST API. I have learned a lot while implementing this project and have always loved MERN stack for implementing the backend for various projects. 
The users can share multiple reviews and manage their previous reviews including updating and deletion.
I have taken special care of Security and Request Validation.

## Tech Stack

**backend:** MongoDB, Javascript, NodeJs, ExpressJs, REST API
**Dependencies** Mongoose, Nodemon, Express, BcryptJS
**Testing Framework** Postman, Nodemon
